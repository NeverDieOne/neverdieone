Hi! My name is Artem and I'm Testing Automation Engineer in Wargaming.

```python
class Programmer:
  def __init__(self):
    self.name = 'Artem'
    self.skills = ['Python', 'Golang', 'JavaScript']
    self.databases = ['Redis', 'PostgreSQL', 'MongoDB']
    self.misc = ['Docker']
```

If I have a free time, then I code on Codewars or reading about code @_@

Now I'm going to get ISTQB Certificate.
